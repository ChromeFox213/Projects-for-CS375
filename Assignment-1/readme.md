This is  the cool shader I chose for Assignment 1!:

This shader is cool because it is interactive and reacts to music!
Not only is it interactive, but it is elegant, and nice to look at.
This shader is made up of only 58 lines of code and is well documented!
This gives me an idea of how it works upon examining the code. The
ring's got a nice 'bloom' effect to it. It grows and shrinks depending
on the music playing.
I'm a sucker for stylish, minimal art, and this has enough details that
don't make it look too simple! The background also has a shadow effect.
Overall, I think it's a good start to observing and implementing
computer graphics!
